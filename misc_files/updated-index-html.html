                <p>For centuries, the naming of streets has been more than a matter of navigation—it's been a reflection of who and what we value as a society. In New York City, one of the most diverse and progressive cities in the world, there exists a stark disparity in representation: of the thousands of streets named after notable individuals, only a small fraction honor women.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This investigation explores this gender gap in NYC's street names, uncovering patterns of underrepresentation and highlighting the remarkable women who have managed to secure their place in the city's geographical nomenclature. Through data visualization and storytelling, we'll examine not just the numbers, but also the stories behind the names—and what they reveal about our collective memory and values.</p>

                <p>The data tells a clear story: despite women making up half of the city's population and contributing significantly to its history, culture, and development, their presence on street signs remains disproportionately small. Even in recent decades, when awareness of gender equity has increased, new street namings continue to favor male honorees at a ratio of [W:1].</p>

                            <p>When Eleanor Roosevelt Boulevard was dedicated in Queens in 1958, it was one of the rare instances where a woman was honored while still living—a testament to her extraordinary influence and respect. As First Lady, diplomat, activist, and author, Roosevelt redefined the role of women in American politics.</p>
                            <p>Born to privilege but acquainted with personal tragedy, Roosevelt transformed herself from a shy debutante into a fearless advocate for civil rights, women's rights, and the rights of the poor and disadvantaged. Her weekly newspaper column "My Day" ran for 27 years, giving Americans unprecedented access to the thoughts of a First Lady.</p>
                            <p>After her husband's death, Roosevelt continued her public service as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations, where she chaired the committee that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—a document she considered her greatest achievement.</p>

                            <p>"Unbought and unbossed" was the slogan of Shirley Chisholm's historic 1972 presidential campaign—the first campaign by a Black woman for a major party's nomination. But long before breaking that barrier, Chisholm was already making history as the first Black woman elected to Congress in 1968, representing her Brooklyn district.</p>
                            <p>Born in Brooklyn to Caribbean immigrant parents, Chisholm's roots in the community ran deep. A former teacher and childcare center director, she brought her passion for education and children's welfare to Albany as a state assemblywoman before heading to Washington.</p>
                            <p>In Congress, she was known for her outspoken advocacy for women, minorities, and the poor. She helped found both the National Women's Political Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus, organizations that continue her legacy of advocacy today.</p>

                            <p>Billie Holiday transformed American music through her distinctive vocal style and emotional intensity. Despite a life marked by hardship and discrimination, "Lady Day," as she was known, created a legacy that continues to influence artists across genres.</p>
                            <p>Born Eleanora Fagan in Philadelphia, Holiday spent much of her youth in Baltimore before moving to Harlem as a teenager. It was in the nightclubs of Harlem that she began singing, developing her unique improvisational technique that would revolutionize vocal jazz.</p>
                            <p>Beyond her musical innovations, Holiday showed tremendous courage in performing "Strange Fruit," a haunting protest against the lynching of Black Americans. The song, which she first performed in 1939, is considered one of the first explicit protest songs of the civil rights movement.</p>

                            <p>Zora Neale Hurston—novelist, folklorist, anthropologist—was a multifaceted talent who captured the African American experience with unparalleled authenticity. Though now recognized as one of the preeminent writers of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston died in obscurity before her work was rediscovered and celebrated decades later.</p>
                            <p>Born in Notasulga, Alabama, and raised in the all-Black town of Eatonville, Florida, Hurston's early experiences in a self-governed Black community shaped her perspective. After studying at Howard University and Barnard College (where she was the sole Black student), Hurston conducted anthropological fieldwork throughout the American South and Caribbean, collecting folklore that would inform her literary works.</p>
                            <p>Her masterpiece novel "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) broke new ground in its portrayal of a Black woman's journey to self-discovery and independence. The novel's use of authentic Black dialect was revolutionary for its time and reflected Hurston's commitment to preserving cultural heritage.</p>

                <p>The stories of these remarkable women represent just a fraction of the female achievements that deserve recognition in our urban landscape. The disparity in street naming is not merely a statistical curiosity—it reflects and reinforces broader patterns of historical erasure and underrepresentation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As New York City continues to evolve, so too does the opportunity to reshape our understanding of history and contribution. Recent initiatives like [specific initiative name] have begun to address this imbalance, with [number] new streets named after women since [year].</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yet the data shows we have far to go before achieving parity. The streets we navigate daily are more than concrete paths—they're daily reminders of whose contributions we've deemed worthy of remembrance. By recognizing this disparity and working to correct it, we take an important step toward a more inclusive understanding of our shared history and identity.</p>
